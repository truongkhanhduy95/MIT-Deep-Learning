        "At a high-level, neural networks are either encoders, decoders, or a combination of both. Encoders find patterns in raw data to form compact, useful representations. Decoders generate new data or high-resolution useful infomation from those representations. As the lecture describes, deep learning discovers ways to **represent** the world so that we can reason about it. The rest is clever methods that help use deal effectively with visual information, language, sound (#1-6) and even act in a world based on this information and occasional rewards (#7).\n",
