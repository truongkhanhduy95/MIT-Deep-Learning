This repository is a collection of tutorials for [MIT Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.mit.edu/) courses. More added as courses progress.

## Tutorial: Deep Learning Basics

This tutorial accompanies the [lecture on Deep Learning Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf&v=O5xeyoRL95U). It presents several concepts in deep learning, demonstrating the first two (feed forward and convolutional neural networks) and providing pointers to tutorials on the others. This is a good place to start.

## Tutorial: Driving Scene Segmentation

This tutorial demostrates semantic segmentation with a state-of-the-art model (DeepLab) on a sample video from the MIT Driving Scene Segmentation Dataset.


## DeepTraffic Deep Reinforcement Learning Competition

DeepTraffic is a deep reinforcement learning competition. The goal is to create a neural network that drives a vehicle (or multiple vehicles) as fast as possible through dense highway traffic.
