    "# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial accompanies lectures of the [MIT Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.mit.edu) series. Acknowledgement to amazing people involved is provided throughout the tutorial and at the end. Introductory lectures on GANs include the following (with more coming soon):\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a framework for training networks optimized for generating new realistic samples from a particular representation. In its simplest form, the training process involves two networks. One network, called the generator, generates new data instances, trying to fool the other network, the discriminator, that classifies images as real or fake. This original form is illustrated as follows (where #6 refers to one of 7 architectures described in the [Deep Learning Basics tutorial](https://github.com/lexfridman/mit-deep-learning/blob/master/tutorial_deep_learning_basics/deep_learning_basics.ipynb)):\n",

    "\n",
    "There are broadly 3 categories of GANs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unsupervised GANs**: The generator network takes random noise as input and produces a photo-realistic image that appears very similar to images that appear in the training dataset. Examples include the [original version of GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661), [DC-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434), [pg-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196), etc.\n",
    "3. **Style-Transfer GANs** - Translate images from one domain to another (e.g., from horse to zebra, from sketch to colored images). Examples include [CycleGAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/) and [pix2pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/).\n",
    "2. **Conditional GANs** - Jointly learn on features along with images to generate images conditioned on those features (e.g., generating an instance of a particular class). Examples includes [Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784), [AC-GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09585), [Stack-GAN](https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN), and [BigGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we illustrate BigGAN, a state-of-the-art conditional GAN from DeepMind. This illustration is based on the [BigGAN TF Hub Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/biggan_generation_with_tf_hub.ipynb) and the BigGAN generators on [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-256). See the [BigGAN paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096) [1] for more information about these models.\n",
